India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent. In the last millennium, the most significant import of cooking techniques into India occurred during the Mughal Empire. Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. India (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. India is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (spoken by 24% of the population). It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government. In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%. India is the world's most populous democracy.\n","\n","Question:  Which are the major Himalayan rivers in India?\n","\n","Answer Tokens:  ['gang', '##es', 'and', 'the', 'bra', '##hma', '##put', '##ra']\n","\n","Answer:  ganges and the brahmaputra\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'ganges and the brahmaputra'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lie0epdLEN01"},"source":["**FLASK**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"X7CA4FLmDS_p","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602679941770,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":49477,"user":{"displayName":"Nirav Raje","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rwxb81DyHSk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABco/BzjCAyIBALo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"10387550002262274732"}}},"source":["%%capture\n","!pip install flask-ngrok"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fjCjJxOrCf-T","outputId":"47c04e7f-db67-4e37-88f9-4e51f31ad2c1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000}},"source":["from flask_ngrok import run_with_ngrok\n","from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n","\n","app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='drive/My Drive/colab_files/Flask/templates')\n","run_with_ngrok(app)   #starts ngrok when the app is run\n","\n","@app.route(\"/\")\n","def home():\n","    return render_template('home.html')\n","\n","@app.route('/about')\n","def about():\n","    return render_template('about.html')\n","\n","@app.route('/handle_data', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n","def handle_data():\n","    url = request.form['inputURL']\n","    question = request.form['inputQuestion']\n","    answer = get_answer(url, question)\n","    print('\\nAnswer: ', answer)\n","    return render_template('handle_data.html', result_url=url, result_question=question,\n","                           result_answer=answer)\n","\n","app.run()\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":[" * Serving Flask app \"__main__\" (lazy loading)\n"," * Environment: production\n","\u001b[31m   WARNING: This is a development server.

Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme. In cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. It can also be used as an inherent part of a cryptocurrency's design. According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions: In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet. Decentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. Aaron Hankins of MarketWatch refers to any cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin as altcoins. In October 2017, BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink called bitcoin an 'index of money laundering'. An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. A \"share\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.

Stephanie Yang of The Wall Street Journal defined altcoins as \"alternative digital currencies,\" while Paul Vigna, also of The Wall Street Journal, described altcoins as alternative versions of bitcoin. Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh. [citation needed] In August 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000 bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. Two members of the Silk Road Task Force—a multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of Silk Road—seized bitcoins for their own use in the course of the investigation.

Aaron Hankins of MarketWatch refers to any cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin as altcoins. The New Yorker has explained the debate based on interviews with blockchain founders in an article about the “argument over whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the blockchain are transforming the world”. According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions: In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1900 BCE) and pre-Vedic Eastern states of India, the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), and the śramaṇa movement. It is the earliest literary work that highlights the fundamentals of yoga. These principles are significant to the history of spiritual side of yoga. One of the earliest and most influential sub-traditions of Vedanta, is Advaita Vedanta, which posits nondualistic monism. Theosophists including Madame Blavatsky also had a large influence on the Western public's view of Yoga. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Yoga is discussed in the ancient foundational Sutras of Hindu philosophy. Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda,[note 1] and also referenced in the Upanishads,. It is His grace which brings about the union. Yoga is one of the six Āstika (orthodox) schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. In the context of yoga sutras, the word Yoga means Union. Zen, the name of which derives from the Sanskrit \"dhyāna\" via the Chinese \"ch'an\"[note 21] is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. It takes the form of a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Gargi, a renowned philosopher. Some key works of this era include the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, the Yoga-Yājñavalkya, the Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra and the Visuddhimagga. The metaphysics of Classical Yoga, like Sāṅkhya, is mainly dualistic, positing that there are two distinct realities. And such evidence as has survived in the Vedas is scanty and indirect. What is often referred to as Classical Yoga, Astanga (Yoga of eight limbs), or Raja Yoga is mainly the type of Yoga outlined in the highly influential Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Each person has an individual puruṣa, which is their true self, the witness and the enjoyer, and that which is liberated. These teachings on cakras and Kundalini would become central to later forms of Indian Yoga.
