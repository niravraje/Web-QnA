       "\"Cricket is the most popular sport in India. In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda. Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton (Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing, and wrestling. India has no national language. Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues. The kameez may have a European-style collar, a Mandarin-collar, or it may be collarless; in the latter case, its design as a women's garment is similar to a kurta. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself. According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045. Increasingly, in urban settings in northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, transformed instead into one for formal occasions. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. At the workplace in urban India, and in international or leading Indian companies, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance. In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date. Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care. The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games.\""
